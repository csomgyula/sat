# SAT

## Goal

Experiment with the [SAT problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) now with 2-SAT, then maybe with the general case: 

- the primary research direction is generating proofs from solvers,
- the secondary direction is the solvers themselves. 

## Problem domain
